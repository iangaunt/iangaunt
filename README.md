I've been developing for about 7 years now. My primary focus is working with the theory and mathematics behind algorithms (and UI design.)

Currently, I'm specializing in web development, particularly in front-end, alongside C++ and Java. I'm also learning DP and algorithms on the side, as well as studying internal hardware and theoretical implementation.

<br>`THINGS I DO SOMETIMES:`

* Lua / Luau (Roact, Rojo)
* HTML & CSS (SCSS & Tailwind)
* Java
* JavaScript (TypeScript, React, Next.js, Webpack)
* C++ (OpenGL, SDL)
* Rust

Currently a first year computer science student at Cal Poly SLO.
