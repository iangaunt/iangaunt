I've been developing for about 7 years now. My primary focus is working with the theory and mathematics behind algorithms (and UI design.)

Currently, I'm specializing in web development, particularly in front-end, alongside C++ (for graphics processing) and Java. I'm also learning DP and algorithms on the side, and have worked with data science in the past.
