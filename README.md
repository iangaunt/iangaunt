Hi! I'm Ian. 

I've been developing for about 6 years now. Currently, I'm specializing in web development, particularly in front-end, alongside Lua and Java. I'm also learning data structures and algorithms on the side.

###### in order of how good I am at them
* Lua / Luau (Roact, Rojo)
* HTML & CSS (Sass, SCSS & Tailwind)
