# `iangaunt` 

Hi! I'm Ian. ðŸ‘‹

I've been developing for about 6 years now. Currently, I'm specializing in web development, particularly in front-end, alongside C++ (for graphics processing) and Java. I'm also learning DP and algorithms on the side, and have worked with data science in the past. 

<br>`THINGS I DO SOMETIMES:` 
###### in order of how good I am at them
* Lua / Luau (Roact, Rojo)
* HTML & CSS (SCSS & Tailwind)
* Java 
* JavaScript (TypeScript, React, Webpack)
* C++, R 

Planning to pursue web / software development, music production, or architecture.
