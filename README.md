# `iangaunt`

Hi! I'm Ian. 

I've been developing for about 5 years now. Currently, I'm specializing in web development, particularly in front-end, and Java. 
<br>`THINGS I DO SOMETIMES:` 
* Lua
* Java
* HTML & CSS (Sass & Tailwind)
* JavaScript (jQuery, TypeScript)
* Python (trying to get back into it)
* C#, C++, Kotlin (one can hope)

Planning to pursue artificial intelligence or architecture.
